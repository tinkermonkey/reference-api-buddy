# 2.1 TTL Configuration Requirements

The cache entry Time To Live should be configurable at two levels: a system default value and per domain configuration

## 2.1.1 Default TTL Configuration

`config.py` should accept a configuration for the number of seconds that a cache entry should be considered live for which is used for all entries unless there is a domain specific value configured.

- `default_ttl_seconds` should have a default value of 1 day (24 * 3600)

- Some code and tests reference a previous intention which was `default_ttl_days`, but that should be replaced with `default_ttl_seconds`

## 2.1.2 Domain TTL Configuration

`config.py` should accept a per-domain ttl value in seconds, and if provided, the cache engine should use this value when setting the ttl for a cache entry
